## DISCO
You can resize images using divs to make them overlap/do other things. 
<br>Some of the code requires a script to run in order for everything to work.
<br>Most it all has resizing build into the base.
## QCC
Scripts for Jquesry/JS must be at the bottom of the body.
Components like the accordian, tabs, and tooltips are distinguished by their id.
Most of the css is all inline as opposed to using a css sheet. 
It can render images from webpages. Does this work if there is no internet? How will this change if the links become invalid? Does the computer generate the image again? If it does can there be malicous code sent through the images/links?
Each has their own massive blob of code to copy in at the start of the program.

I really enjoy the old bootstrap since I think having easily edited charts and tables is much more useful than those of resizing the website page. TW does have some cool niche features though.
